<p>I had my website but I ran into a few questions; mainly,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>how to upload pdf (solved)</li>
<li>rendering problem</li>
<li>how to sync my local computer to another local computer (I’m going to buy a new laptop and I wonder how to sync github to the new laptop)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the note for the meeting.</p>
<p>file -&gt; create new project install::blogdown_hugo() blogdown::new_site(theme = “gcushen/hugo-academic”) #a website should appear modify config.toml under content &gt; home &gt; you can modify whether you want the wedge appear or not</p>
