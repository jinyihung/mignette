<p>I had my website but I ran into a few questions; mainly,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>how to upload pdf</li>
<li>rendering problem</li>
<li>how to sync my local computer to another local computer (I’m going to buy a new laptop and I wonder how to sync github to the new laptop)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the note for the meeting.</p>
<p>library(blogdown) blogdown:::install_hugo</p>
<p>file &gt; new projects (I missed this part)</p>
<p>blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot; yihui/hugo-xmin“, theme_example = TRUE) blogdown:::serve_site()</p>
