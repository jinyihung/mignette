I had my website but I ran into a few questions; mainly,

1. how to upload pdf (solved)
2. rendering problem
3. how to sync my local computer to another local computer (I'm going to buy a new laptop and I wonder how to sync github to the new laptop)


Here is the note for the meeting. 


file -> create new project
install::blogdown_hugo()
blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic") #a website should appear
modify config.toml
under content > home > you can modify whether you want the wedge appear or not
