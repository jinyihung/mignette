Thanks to [Dr. Nick Tierney](http://www.njtierney.com/) and [Dr. Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/). I was able to modifed [HUGO XMIN](https://xmin.yihui.name/). 

Another useful tutorial: http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html

For some reason I was not able to build a website based on a complex template (e.g., academic) but I started to enjoy the simple template and the flexibility and challenge to modify the website to the way I want.

There is still a lot to learn, especially about css, but things are coming along (I hope).

Status: working on my website...
