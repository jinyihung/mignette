Highlight from the article

Elements of a vector can be selected or replaced using the square bracket operator [ ]
```{r}
capColor = c(huey = "red", duey = "blue", louie = "green")
capColor["louie"]
names(capColor)[capColor == "blue"]


x <- c(4, 7, 6, 5, 2, 8)
I <- x < 6
J <- x > 7
x[I | J]
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
x[c(-1, -2)]

```

Replacing values in vectors can be done in the same way.
```{r}
x <- 1:10
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)] <- 1
```
