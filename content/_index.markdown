I am a speech‐language scientist with specific training in the breakdown of human semantic processing and its impact on language. My long‐term research objective is to understand the neural basis of language and cognition, their impairments by neurogenic disorders, and to develop evidencebased programs for rehabilitation. I utilize multimodal methods, combining techniques such as behavioral measures, neuromodulation (tDCS), and eye‐tracking paradigm, to determine how the human brain represents discrete facets of language in healthy and individuals with neurogenic disorders.
