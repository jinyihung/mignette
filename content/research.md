### Structure of semantic memory and the process of accessing word meanings
With eyetracking, I focus on the semantically guided visual search, especially to develop systematic measures for the semantic feature search (e.g., where do healthy controls vs. individuals with neurogenic disorders look at on an image of an object and action).  I aim to (1) determine the top-down conceptual control overtime, and (2) examine the visual salient features for action and object concepts. Specifically, I will use eyetracking as a biomarker for the detection of early cognitive and language decline in the aging population and track individualsâ€™ eye movement overtime to examine the trajectory of their language breakdown. 


### Neuromodulation and neuroimaging for language breakdown and maintenance
Since healthy aging serves as a critical baseline from which deterioration starts to reveal for many neurogenic disorders, one of my current goals is to evaluate the network changes that supply our core semantic system following aging.  The use of neuroimaging is essential in identifying nodes of the network and their dynamic activation patterns. This allows me to examine language network activation related to aging vs. the patterns that are unique to neurogenic disorders.
