title: About me
---

My name is Jinyi Hung. I am a speech‐language scientist with specific training in the breakdown of human semantic processing and its impact on language. My long‐term research objective is to understand the neural basis of language and cognition, their impairments by neurogenic disorders, and to develop evidencebased programs for rehabilitation. I utilize multimodal methods, combining techniques such as behavioral measures, neuromodulation (tDCS), and eye‐tracking paradigm, to determine how the human brain represents discrete facets of language in healthy and individuals with neurogenic disorders.

I enjoy human neuroscience, R programming language, statistics, and neuroimaging. I use MOOC and attend local workshops to learn about these topics and I appreciate open learning and open science.

My favorite classes I've taken: Human neuroanatmoy at UF, Synapses Neuron and Brain by Dr. Idan Segev, and Research method courses by Dr. Michael Marsiske. I found my passion in the brain science through several courses in the related content area (Dr. Peggy Mason from U Chicago, Dr. Leonard White from Duke). Dr. Segev's online course gave me a new perspective to approach to the brain science. Dr. Marsiske's class provided me a solid foundation in research method.

While I'm not doing science, I enjoy photography and writing. I specifically like doing 7-sec video to record the sound for static photos.
